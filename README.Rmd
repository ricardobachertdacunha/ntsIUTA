# ntsIUTA

The objective of `ntsIUTA` is to facilitate the development and routine use of application driven workflows for non-target screening, using open source tools. The packages `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")`, `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` and `r Biocpkg("xcms")` play a fundamental role to `ntsIUTA`. Therefore, installation and experience with these packages is recommended.


## Installation

`ntsIUTA` depends on external open source software. Therefore, installation of these dependencies should occur beforehand as described in following Prerequisites section.

## Prerequisites

Confirm that [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed and the PATH is set up correctly in the environmental variables. To set the PATH the following line can be used where PATH is the location of the RTools bin folder.

```{r install_RTools, eval=FALSE}
writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")
```

`ntsIUTA` largely depends on `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")` package and both have a large number of common dependencies. Therefore, installation of `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")` is recommended before installing `ntsIUTA`. An installation guide for the `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")` package can be found [here](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/installation.html). `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")` also provides an [automatic installation script](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/automatic-installation-windows-only.html) for Windows users. Alternatively, a  [manual installation guide](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/manual-installation.html) is also provided. The most basic steps of the `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")` installation are as follows.

```{r install_external, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rickhelmus/patRoon", upgrade = "never")

#Direct installation of packages from Bioconductor
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("CAMERA", "mzR", "xcms", "Biobase", "MSnbase"))

```

The code above installs a basic configuration of `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")`. External software, such as [proteowizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/download.html), [MetFrag](https://ipb-halle.github.io/MetFrag/projects/metfragcl/), needs to be installed and referenced in the `.Rprofile` manually as suggested [here](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/installation.html). Alternatively, the automatic installation of `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")` can be used which creates the `.Rprofile-patRoon.R` with all required locations of the external software used in `r Githubpkg("rickhelmus/patRoon")` and consequently `ntsIUTA`.

## Installation of the ntsIUTA package

After installing the prerequisites, the `ntsIUTA`package can then be installed from the [ntsIUTA GitHub repository](https://github.com/ricardobachertdacunha/ntsIUTA) using the code line below. 

```{r install_ntsIUTA, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ricardobachertdacunha/ntsIUTA")
```


## Information

Loading `ntsIUTA`:

```{r example}
library(ntsIUTA)
```

<!-- See vignettes: -->
```{r vignettesExamples}

```


<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
